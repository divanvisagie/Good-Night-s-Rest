# ðŸŒ™ Welcome to "Good Night's Rest" ðŸŒ™

I'm working on a (free) REST client (just a hobby, won't be a big and professional 
cloud platform like Insomnia) for those who believe that REST is best enjoyed 
without clouds looming overhead. This has been brewing since "the incident,"
and it's starting to take shape. I'd love to hear any feedback on things people 
like/dislike in existing REST clients, as Good Night's REST aims to offer a dreamy
experience (with a sprinkle of jokes to make you snore... I mean, smile!).

## The Problem
Are you tired of open-source projects that rug pull and suddenly try to become 
a cloud service even though they're basically a generic wrapper around the unit 
tests you write every day?

Are you tired of launching an entire desktop browser engine for every 
application on your desktop?

## The Solution
Well, we don't want you to be tired; we want you to sleep easy knowing that this 
simple application, which you could probably rewrite in a weekend, 
will always be open source. That's why it's licensed as GPL 2, the way Linus intended.

And yes, it's written in Rust, because why rewrite it in a weekend when you 
can "Rewrite it in Rust" and have peace of mind? 
(And also a ton of compile-time errors, but hey, that's a small price to pay for tranquillity.)
